# Professional Profile

I have over 5 years of blended experience ranging between data science to product and strategy from conception to launch in both startups and large enterprise settings. I double majored in Physics and Applied Math at Johns Hopkins University and have an MBA from MIT Sloan School of Management. Most recently, I was the CEO and Co-Founder of Seismiq, a B2B SaaS startup automating data pipeline observability for developers.

I'm most passionate about products at the intersection of technology, data, and user experience. Whether I'm conducting customer interviews, developing AI/ML models, or creating intuitive UI/UX strategies, I'm passionate about solving real-world problems through innovative solutions.

## **SEISMIQ AI:** Feb 2024 to Oct 2024

Developed a zero-configuration solution that reduced implementation from a multi-day process to a single line of code, adapting software monitoring best practices specifically for data platform and analytics teams. Through customer discovery (60+ interviews), I secured verbal pilot commitments from several high-growth startups ($200M+ to $1B+ valuations).
